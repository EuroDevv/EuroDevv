Looking forward to sell my kernel injector source as I don't use it anymore. Initially designed for Call of Duty MW 2019, it works for Cold War, MW2, MW3, and various other games. Please note, I've personally tested it on a limited number of anti-cheats and found it does NOT function with EAC due to the driver being blocked. However, it will work if you change the driver with an undetected one. I have not tested on Battleye which I know is another common question.

The kernel injector works for both Windows 10/11. For those seeking an EAC injector, this provides a good base, necessitating only the driver change mentioned above. If you're in search of a COD injector, it stands as a pretty good choice. While this injector presents a cost-effective and fairly undetected option, it's not the best.

The source code comes with the Driver itself and a KeyAuth system that downloads your dll (dll never touches your pc). I would not use this as a p2c unless you make some changes. FYI, I DID NOT code this. This was given to me by a COD Cheat developer over 6 months ago. This was used as a p2c for MW19 tools. I'm selling the source as is if you need help with anything I will try my best to help.
